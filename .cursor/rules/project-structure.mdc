# Project Structure Guide

- The main entry point is [src/main.ts](mdc:src/main.ts), which bootstraps the NestJS application.
- Application modules are located in [src/modules/](mdc:src/modules/), organized by feature (e.g., users, cart, catalog, otps).
- Each module typically contains its own controllers, services, models, DTOs, and entities.
- Shared utilities and services are in [src/utils/](mdc:src/utils/).
- Database schema files are in [prisma/schema/](mdc:prisma/schema/).
- The main application module is [src/app.module.ts](mdc:src/app.module.ts).
- Configuration and build files are in the project root (e.g., [package.json](mdc:package.json), [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)).
